# _BALL x PIT_

_BALL x PIT_ fuses a brick-breaking core with survival roguelite runs, **ball-fusing** upgrades, and **base-building** between stages. You batter waves with ricocheting orbs, mine the Pit for resources, expand your homestead, and **recruit unique heroes** with powerful passives. Developed by Kenny Sun and Friends and published by Devolver Digital, it launched on Oct 15, 2025 on PC/PS5/Xbox Series X|S/Nintendo Switch, with a free upgrade for Switch 2.

## Why it’s fun

1. **Hybrid loop**: frantic brick-breaking combat during runs; **town/production** planning between runs; on-the-fly **orb fusion/evolution** to craft builds.
2. **Heroes & boss variety**: mid-game **dual-hero parties** enable passive synergies; boss encounters shift into vertical, bullet-hell style fights for a different tempo.
3. **Active post-launch support**: a recent patch added **full-color encyclopedia icons** and key fixes, improving clarity and flow.
