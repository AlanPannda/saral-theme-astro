# The King is Watching

A pixel-art roguelite kingdom builder where only the tiles under your Royal Gaze produce or train. You juggle economy vs. army while waves march along the road.

## Core Loop

**Place & arrange** farms, mines, workshops and barracks on the left grid; watch the enemy road on the right.

**Drive production with Gaze**: buildings only work when covered; expand/reshape your Gaze over time.

**Field your army**: trained units auto\-battle on the road; reconfigure base and Gaze between waves. 

**Events & modifiers** mix up each run;

**Meta progression** unlocks more options between attempts.

Meta progression unlocks more options between attempts.

The sensory profile of a Tuesday is similarly muted. The sound of a Tuesday is the low hum of an air conditioner. The taste of a Tuesday is a slightly stale biscuit you found in the office pantry near the sad-looking succulents. Its official bird is the pigeon—ubiquitous, functional, and largely ignored. Writing this on a vibrant Saturday here in Pune, the memory of last Tuesday is already fading into a featureless taupe haze.

## Conclusion

We should not fight the beige-ness of Tuesday. We should embrace it. Schedule your most boring meetings for Tuesday. Wear your most unremarkable outfit. Let the day be what it is: a quiet, unassuming bridge to the more interesting parts of the week. There is a strange, understated beauty in its utter lack of drama.
