Ah, my glorious kingdom! A land where peasants toil, miners dig, and knights train... but only when I look at them! My gaze is law—progress thrives where I watch, but the moment I turn away? Laziness! Chaos! I must choose wisely: should I focus on the fields for food, the mines for riches, or the barracks for defense? With resources, I can even expand my all-seeing gaze, ensuring my kingdom flourishes… and that no one slacks off under my rule!

## Stuff to know

Water, wheat, stone, coal, silver—every resource fuels my empire! Farms feed my people, mines fund my ambitions, and workshops forge mighty defenses. Shall I invest in archers, reinforce the walls, or harness magic? Even my castle needs repairs when the enemy strikes! Every decision shapes my reign, and only a well-managed kingdom will survive the storm.

The sensory profile of a Tuesday is similarly muted. The sound of a Tuesday is the low hum of an air conditioner. The taste of a Tuesday is a slightly stale biscuit you found in the office pantry near the sad-looking succulents. Its official bird is the pigeon—ubiquitous, functional, and largely ignored. Writing this on a vibrant Saturday here in Pune, the memory of last Tuesday is already fading into a featureless taupe haze.

## Conclusion

We should not fight the beige-ness of Tuesday. We should embrace it. Schedule your most boring meetings for Tuesday. Wear your most unremarkable outfit. Let the day be what it is: a quiet, unassuming bridge to the more interesting parts of the week. There is a strange, understated beauty in its utter lack of drama.
